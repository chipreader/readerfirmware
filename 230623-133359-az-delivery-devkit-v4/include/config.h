// This is the most important switch: It defines if you want to use Mifare Classic or Desfire EV1 cards.
// If you set this define to false the users will only be identified by the UID of a Mifare Classic or Desfire card.
// This mode is only for testing if you have no Desfire cards available.
// Mifare Classic cards have been cracked due to a badly implemented encryption.
// It is easy to clone a Mifare Classic card (including it's UID).
// You should use Defire EV1 cards for any serious door access system.
// When using Desfire EV1 cards a 16 byte data block is stored in the card's EEPROM memory
// that can only be read with the application master key.
// To clone a Desfire card it would be necessary to crack a 168 bit 3K3DES or a 128 bit AES key data which is impossible.
// If the Desfire card does not contain the correct data the door will not open even if the UID is correct.

// But the disadvantage of AES encryption is that it increases the power consumption of the card more than DES.
// The maximum read distance is 5,3 cm when using 3DES keys and 4,0 cm when using AES keys.
// (When USE_DESFIRE == false the same Desfire card allows a distance of 6,3 cm.)
// If the card is too far away from the antenna you get a timeout error at the moment when the Authenticate command is executed.
// IMPORTANT: Before changing this compiler switch, please execute the RESTORE command on all personalized cards!
